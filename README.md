Welcome, terminal tinkerers and command-line enthusiasts! Iâ€™m thrilled to share our journey through the **minishell** project, one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences at 42 Berlin. This collaborative endeavor goes beyond simple codingâ€”it's about understanding the inner workings of shells, processes, signals, and user interactions. By recreating features reminiscent of a classic bash environment, Weâ€™ve gained invaluable insights into system-level programming and team coordination.

## About

**minishell** isnâ€™t just another assignmentâ€”itâ€™s a deep dive into how command interpreters operate under the hood. Together with a fellow student, Iâ€™ve worked on designing and implementing:

- **Command Parsing & Execution:** Handling user input, interpreting quotes and expansions, and executing the right binaries from `$PATH`.
- **Redirections & Pipes:** Using `<`, `>`, `<<`, `>>`, and `|` to reroute input/output streams, link multiple commands, and simulate pipelines.
- **Built-In Commands:** Reimplementing essential shell commands like `echo`, `cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`, `env`, and `exit`.
- **Signal Handling & Terminal Behavior:** Managing signals (`ctrl-C`, `ctrl-D`, `ctrl-\`) gracefully, ensuring that the shell responds just like a standard bash shell in interactive mode.
- **Environment Variable Expansion:** Expanding `$VAR` and `$?` to reflect the current environment and the exit status of the last command.

Throughout this project, Weâ€™ve confronted many intricate challenges:
- Mastering the use of `fork`, `execve`, `pipe`, and other low-level functions.
- Synchronizing processes and avoiding race conditions.
- Ensuring no unclosed quotes break the logic and that special characters are handled correctly.
- Managing a reliable command history and handling edge cases like `ctrl-D` (end of input) gracefully.
- Adhering to strict code norms and practices while developing a robust, maintainable codebase.

This project was tested and developed on **Linux** systems, guaranteeing a stable and portable environment.

## Core Mechanics

**minishell** recreates a subset of bash features, focusing on correctness and robustness:

1. **Prompt & History:** Displays a prompt and keeps track of command history via `readline`.
2. **Parsing & Quoting:** Handles single and double quotes, preventing unwanted interpretation of metacharacters.
3. **Redirections & Pipes:** Redirects input and output, and supports multiple commands chained with pipes.
4. **Variable Expansion:** Expands environment variables and `$?` to reflect the last commandâ€™s exit status.
5. **Builtins Implemented:**
   - `echo` (with `-n` option)
   - `cd` (with relative or absolute paths)
   - `pwd`
   - `export`
   - `unset`
   - `env`
   - `exit`
6. **Signals & Special Keys:**
   - `ctrl-C` starts a new prompt on a new line (in interactive mode).
   - `ctrl-D` exits the shell.
   - `ctrl-\` does nothing (in interactive mode).
   
**No extraneous globals:** We avoided using global variables, except for a single global variable to indicate a received signal numberâ€”ensuring a clean and maintainable design.

## Challenges & Learnings

This project elevated our understanding of:
- **System Programming:** Diving deep into POSIX functions and process creation.
- **Memory Management & Error Handling:** Ensuring every allocation is checked and properly freed.
- **Synchronization & Signals:** Managing asynchronous events without data races or inconsistent states.
- **Code Structuring & Teamwork:** Collaborating effectively, maintaining a clear architecture, and documenting code for mutual understanding.

**minishell** taught us to approach problems methodically, test frequently, and anticipate edge cases. The result is a robust, minimalistic shell that simulates a mini-bash environment and solidifies a foundation for future system-level projects.
